# multiwindow example

__This project is only compatible with an unmerged WIP version of the flutter framework/engine, and may quickly become out of date__

Code demonstrating WIP multiwindow capabilities of flutter. You need to use a custom engine built [this branch](https://github.com/wmww/flutter_engine/tree/sophie-multiwindow) and a custom version of the framework built from [this commit](https://github.com/goderbauer/flutter/commit/4c09d4ce87c7e7af5a41c78b6da1bb9e80011d17) from [this branch](https://github.com/goderbauer/flutter/tree/multiview2). The code here is copied from [this repo](https://github.com/goderbauer/scratchpad/tree/main/custom_embedding). Works (somewhat) with Linux and Mac.
